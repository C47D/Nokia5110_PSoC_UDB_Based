# PSoC Nokia5110 Custom Component

Custom Component for Nokia5110 displays, this component is based on SPI peripheral, this is a UDB based SPI on PSoC4 and PSoC 5LP devices.

Internal driver of the Nokia5110 display works at 4MHz so SPI must work at that freq. aswell.

Improvements are welcome.

PSoC Rocks!
